This is the follow on code to the course Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms in Udemy by Andrei Neagoie.


## Data Structures

### Arrays
Well arrays are a common data structure in code interviews. However, they have their pros and cons. Let's list them:

* Fast Lookups
* Fast push/pop
* Ordered

Bad: 
* Slow inserts
* Slow deletes
* Fixed sizes (if you use static array)
